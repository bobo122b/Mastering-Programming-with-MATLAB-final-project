# Mastering-Programming-with-MATLAB-final-project
The final project of the course "Mastering Programming with MATLAB"
This project is a work that I have made hardly, I tried to keep the code as clean and as fast as possible, but there may be faster approaches of vectoization and using MATLAB's built-in functions.
I hope you like my project.
